Todo program based on waking up series on time management.

Need buckets of tasks.
- active tasks (max 10)
- queue bucket (max inf)
- done list (max inf)

Active bucket:
- input: choose task from queue bucket to go into active list
- process:
	- list tasks in queue bucket
	- user enters the id of the task they want to add to active bucket
	- deny user from entering more than x amount of tasks into active bucket
	- write task from queue csv to active csv
	- delete task from queue csv
	- bring user back to main menu
- output: a new active task list that includes the new task

Queue bucket:
- input: 
	- task name
	- task due date (can be null)
	- task description (can be null)
	- task difficulty rating (1 - 3, can be null)
	- whether the task is part of a project (and what project)
	- bring user back to main menu
- process: 
	- auto-generate timestamp for task
	- write task to csv file
- output:
	- confirmation that the task has been written to active bucket

Done bucket: (User will usually not go here.)
- input:
	- task name
	- task due date (can be null)
	- task description (can be null)
	- task difficulty rating (1 - 3, can be null)
	- whether the task is part of a project (and what project)
	- bring user back to main menu	
- process:
	- user will see done list in the same way they view the queue list
	- option to add a completed task to bucket
- output: 
	- confirmation that the task has been added

Functions:

list_bucket()
write_bucket()


Tables:

Tasks
	id		: int
	title		: str
	description	: str
	difficulty	: int (1-3)
	project		: str
	due_date	: datetime
	create_date	: datetime	
	status		: 'active', 'queue', 'done'

------------------------
FEATURES TO ADD:
- rot : As the (current date - created date) increases, the rot score increases. Sort tasks shown to user by default by (rot DESC, difficulty ASC)
- ability for user to add tasks directly to active task list (if less than 10 tasks exist)
- ask user whether they want to replace the task they just completed or not
